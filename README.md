### Scientific Question

Can satellite based estimates of carbon export be used to improve the numeric relationship between export production and its paleo-proxy, particulate excess barium (pBa), in the Pacific basin?


### Datasets

- [GEOTRACES GP15](https://www.bodc.ac.uk/data/published_data_library/catalogue/10.5285/cf2d9ba9-d51d-3b7c-e053-8486abc0f5fd/)  trace element and isotope (TEI) data

- [Vertically Generalized Production Model (VGPM)](http://orca.science.oregonstate.edu/1080.by.2160.8day.xyz.vgpm.m.chl.m.sst.php) sea surface temperature and primary production satellite data

- [SIMPLE-TRIM](https://tdevries.eri.ucsb.edu/models-and-data-products/) carbon export model output


### Analysis Summary

TEI data from the GEOTRACES GP15 cruise in the Pacific Ocean will be used to calculate pBa fluxes throughout the water column. These fluxes will then be compared with two different satellite based estimates of carbon export. A numeric relationship will be derived between these two quantities in order to better constrain $pBa_{xs}$ as a paleo-proxy for carbon export production.
